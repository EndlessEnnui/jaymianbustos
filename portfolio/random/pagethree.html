  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
      <body>

        Presented here is my Original Character Slot Machine. I wanted to create something similar to a video game that describes characters that I and my significant other have made in the past.
              </br>

              </br>
        Features:
      </br>

        Button that randomizes 5 different icons corresponding to a character/item.
              </br>
              </br>
        Upon getting three of the same icon, text will appear describing the icon and victory music will play.
              </br>
              </br>
        Jackpot (Character) shifts side to side.
              </br>
              </br>
        Music plays/pauses by pressing 1 and 2 respectively.
