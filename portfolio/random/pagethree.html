  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
      <body>

        Presented here is my Original Character Slot Machine. I wanted to create something similar to a video game that describes characters that I and my significant other have made in the past. During the creation of this project, I began teaching myself pixel art on Aseprite. So I used this project as a means to practice creating assets for games I would want to make in the future.

        Upon getting three of the same icon, text will appear describing the icon and victory music will play.
